Tasker - A To-do & Have-done List

Todo:
-Use tasker for this todo list
-Improve pretty-printing
-Add support for filters
-Add support for different file locations
-Add support for different file permissions
-Add support for more common lisp implementations
-Add shell tab completion
-Add support for time


How to use:
Get tasks.lisp up and running in SBCL.
Use tasker.py to communicate with tasks.lisp. The API is documented below.

Profit


Notes:
The fifos that tasker and tasks use to communicate are world-readable and
world-writable. This is useful if you want to have multiple users use the same
task list. If any of the users are malicious, they can cause the scripts to
become unresponsive. If any of the users are incompetent, they can irreparably
damage the list.
Any of the commands below can be shortened, if it's unambiguous which command
you want.
Be careful not to forget an argument.
	`tasker.py modify-task --rowid 1 --due-date --project` will set the
due date to "--project".


API:
tasker.py list-tasks
	Lists all tasks.
tasker.py add-task --due-date [due-date] --project [project] --tags [tags]
		   --plist [plist] --notes [notes] --completed [completed]
	Adds a new task.
tasker.py modify-task --rowid [rowid] --due-date [due-date] --project [project]
		      --tags [tags] --plist [plist] --notes [notes]
		      --completed [completed]
	Updates task. Only rowid is required.
tasker.py complete-task --rowid [rowid]
	Marks the task identified by rowid as complete. Exactly the same as
	`tasker.py modify-task --rowid rowid --complete 1`
tasker.py quit
	Close tasks.lisp.
tasker.py exit
	Synonym for quit.


Misc:
Why so many text fields?
	It's to improve filtering (when that gets implemented), and it's just
what seemed natural to me. 'project' is for grouping multiple tasks. 'tags' is
just a list of extra tags. 'plist' is a list of tags that take arguments or
have other values associated with them (e.g., location: home or location:
work). 'notes' is for more miscellaneous info that isn't meant to be searched.
Why another to-do list program?
	I wanted something that also kept tracked of completed tasks. I did not
find any solution that could do that out-of-the-box.
